# SSO Multi-RP Core — Progress Ledger

**Plan:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-26-sso-multi-rp-core.md`
**Branch:** `feature/sso-multi-rp-core`
**Worktree:** `/home/webadmin/web-stack/html/amma-wallet/.claude/worktrees/sso-multi-rp-core`
**Main checkout:** `/home/webadmin/web-stack/html/amma-wallet` (DO NOT commit here)

---

## CRITICAL: Worktree Isolation Rule

**Every subagent MUST work and commit exclusively inside the worktree directory:**
```
/home/webadmin/web-stack/html/amma-wallet/.claude/worktrees/sso-multi-rp-core
```

**NEVER `cd` to or commit in the main checkout** (`/home/webadmin/web-stack/html/amma-wallet`).
Commits made in the main checkout land on `main`, not the feature branch — this
pollutes the production branch with in-progress implementation code.

### Incident: Stray Commit on Main (2026-08-26, Session 1)

During the first session, a subagent committed the Task 1 schema changes directly
to `main` instead of the worktree's `feature/sso-multi-rp-core` branch. The commit
had to be identified and the situation diagnosed in Session 2 before work could
resume. Root cause: the subagent was given the repo path but not explicitly told
to work inside the worktree directory. Resolution: commit was re-done correctly
in the worktree (9cc15b1). Main was found clean at 2d03ba3 (docs only).

**Prevention for Tasks 2–7:** Each subagent prompt MUST include:
1. The exact worktree path as `cd` target
2. An explicit instruction: "Work and commit ONLY in this directory"
3. Never reference the main checkout path
